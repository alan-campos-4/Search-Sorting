# Search and Soring Algorithms

This is a project meant to showcase different seach and sorting algorithms.
It is derived from the final project for the Algorithm Analysis subject of the Computer Science degree I finished back in May 2023.

As of the last update it includes the following algorithms:

Search:
  - Linear/Sequential
  - Binary
  - Interpolation

Sorting: 
  - BubbleSort
  - Selection
  - Insertion
  - QuickSort
  - Partition
  - ShakerSort
  - MergeSort
